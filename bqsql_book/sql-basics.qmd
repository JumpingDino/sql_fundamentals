# The First Steps

In SQL there is a subset of knowledge that is focused on retrieving data from tables. This is called DQL (Data Query Language). 

Bigquery is a very DQL-centric database, by this way our queries are optimized to **SELECT** information (columns) from tables so we can perform analysis and use this data to help us answer questions by data-centric way.

To retrieve information from a table, we need to inform for the query engine which table we want to retrieve information **FROM**

This leads us for the most basic command to retrieve information from any database:

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM <table>
```

SELECT * is known as "SLEECT star" is a way to fetch all the columns from the table. Even that this technique looks good, it's normally not oprimized for queries because it can scale the compute resources of your query significantally.

-- Sometimes you are going to be dealing with huge number of data, this is why it's important to filter, or to limit the data.

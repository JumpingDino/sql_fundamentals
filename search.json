The knowledge on this specific subset of SQL commands are important so the actor can retrieve the data in a way it will help us answer questions with an analytical approach.",

This technique looks easy and efortless, however it’s not optimal to run this to retrieve information from table that are too big since it may increase the cloud cost significantly due to the usage of computational resources.",

For example, if we are analyzing air quality, we may want to analyze the data from a specific country, for example, Brazil. This can be done with the following query:\n\n\nSELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.openaq.global_air_quality`\nWHERE country = \"BR\"\n\n\nTo reduce the usage of computational resources (costs), one way is to filter the number of columns you are currently retrieving. Another way is to – Sometimes you are going to be dealing with huge number of data, this is why it’s important to filter, or to limit the data.\n\n\nSELECT \n    user_id\n    , COUNT(*) as total\nFROM \n    `project.dataset.table`\nWHERE \n    event_date &gt;= '2024-01-01'\nGROUP BY user_id\nORDER BY total DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\n\n\n\n\nnumbers\nplus_one\nsquare\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n3\n4\n9",
